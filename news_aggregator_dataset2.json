    "date": "2024-05-09",
    "post_content": "Communication remains a basic necessity no matter how much humanity moves forward. The digital era has brought a myriad of online tools that bring people together, and it was a rather swift transition from postcards to Discord groups.\nInstant messaging applications with social elements, such as Slack, Discord or WhatsApp, operate as communication enablers for hundreds of millions of users worldwide. Both individuals and businesses utilize the rich features and ease of use found in such applications.\nHowever, as the power of communication becomes more concentrated under the hands of a few centralized services, a certain set of concerns arise:\nPrivacy and data security: Centralized platforms store user data on servers controlled by a single entity, making them attractive targets for hackers and raising concerns about how these companies use the data for advertising or other purposes.\nCensorship: Centralized entities can censor or moderate content according to their policies or external pressures, leading to arbitrary removal of content or entire communities.\nService outages: Centralization means that every user is affected if the service\u2019s servers go down. This creates a single point of failure.\nMonetization and advertisements: Centralized platforms may prioritize profit over user experience, leading to invasive advertising or selling user data to third parties.\nHow decentralization can improve digital communication\nDecentralized networks offer solutions to the biggest pain points of the Web2-era communication. Blockchain-based decentralization can potentially enhance privacy and security by distributing data across numerous points on the network, making it harder for unauthorized parties to access or compromise user information.\nWithout a centralized entity controlling the communication network, censorship and outage risks can be minimized. Thanks to the user-centric nature of Web3, it\u2019s also easier to enable new monetization models that empower participants.\nThe concept of a decentralized application (DApp) for instant messaging grew quickly over the years, giving birth to several examples. However, providing on-chain communication with Web2-like features is easier said than done. Most DApps that attempt to offer Web2-like features encounter significant hurdles.\nWhile decentralization enhances privacy and reduces censorship, it often comes at the cost of performance and user experience. For instance, achieving real-time communication \u2014 which is critical for user satisfaction in messaging apps \u2014 is more complex on a decentralized network due to increased latency and inconsistent data synchronization across nodes.\nFurthermore, most DApps compromise by handling user-facing, front-end features off-chain to maintain performance. This approach dilutes the principles of decentralization and limits the functionality and scalability of these applications. As a result, while DApps represent a promising frontier in digital communication, their current implementations are often incomplete and do not fully harness the advantages of blockchain technology.\nAdvertisement\nTrade smart with Markets Pro instant alerts. Claim your 65% discount now!\nAd\nFully on-chain communication at scale\nOpenChat, a crypto messaging platform, aims to herald a new era in digital communication, leveraging the power of blockchain technology to deliver a unique, decentralized chatting experience. The platform promises enhanced security and autonomy for users, positioning them prominently in the development of Web3 and making it a relevant choice for those interested in the future of online interaction. OpenChat is running digital communication end-to-end \u2014 including front-end \u2014 on the Internet Computer (ICP).\nOpenChat is made possible by ICP, a blockchain network designed to expand the functionalities of the internet, offering a platform for smart contracts and DApps to run at web speed directly on the blockchain. ICP\u2019s unique infrastructure aims to unlock the full potential of DApps, helping them perform at traditional Web2 speeds while keeping the whole process on the blockchain.\nOpenChat provides Discord-like servers in a decentralized environment. Source: OpenChat\nRunning on ICP makes it possible for OpenChat to offer the same performance and feature set as Discord or Slack while providing full benefits of decentralization, including data security, reliability and censorship resistance. On top of traditional chat features, OpenChat is also equipped with crypto-native functionality, allowing users to send and receive tokens as chat messages and swap tokens either through integrations with exchanges or in a peer-to-peer fashion.\nThe communication DApp has recently introduced video and voice chat support, with the initial launch including one-to-one video calls in direct chats and group video calls of up to twenty people in private chats. OpenChat\u2019s phase two will target community broadcasts.\nWeb3 chat app governed by its users\nThe idea of decentralization and end-to-end on-chain communication offered by OpenChat has received a warm welcome from the ICP ecosystem. The project raised over 1 million ICP (worth $5.5 million at the time of fundraising) in five hours in March 2023 to become a fully functional decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) led by its community of shareholders.\nAs part of the ICP ecosystem, OpenChat is now controlled by a DAO and uses CHAT as its governance token. CHAT tokenholders will be able to govern the platform and make their voices heard regarding the future of OpenChat, Matt Grogan, co-founder of OpenChat, said at the time.\nOpenChat also offers a video chat feature. Source: OpenChat\nIn August, after the successful transition into a DAO, OpenChat enabled users to create Communities \u2014 servers with a Discord-meets-Slack style that enables group admins to create subgroups for more focused conversations. Users can find communities based on common interests or create their own. OpenChat co-founder Julian Jelfs shared plans to enable the OpenChat Communities feature for projects to integrate as a communication tool on their own websites.\nThe roadmap for decentralized communication\nOne of the primary goals of the DApp is to introduce end-to-end encryption for chats in 2024 to offer superior security and privacy. The roadmap of OpenChat also includes a sophisticated tokenization system to reward users for posting key content with CHAT tokens. The development team is fully pledged to keep pace with major Web2 competitors and lead innovation in Web3, meaning the feature set of OpenChat will evolve and expand as digital communication advances.\nOpenChat will be featured in the upcoming global ICPCC event on May 10, which will showcase how ICP technology can enhance decentralized applications on any blockchain.\nFully decentralized platforms like OpenChat aim to address the privacy, security and centralization challenges by offering enhanced privacy, reduced censorship and a user-governed ecosystem. It promises to safeguard user data and empower users through community-led governance and innovative monetization strategies planned for the future.\nLearn more about OpenChat\n#Blockchain\n#Adoption\n#DApps\n#DAO\n#Web3\nDisclaimer.

According to Stark, developers have made significant headway toward this goal, culminating in the testing of transactions on Lightning:\n\u201CWe released an early part of the code in October and recently demoed the first-ever transaction on Lightning of an asset. The idea is to have crypto dollars and stablecoins on the Bitcoin blockchain.\u201D\nStark added that traditionally, these digital assets have operated on other blockchains that have suffered from high fees and other issues. She argues that Bitcoin\u2019s network is perhaps best placed to facilitate the use of stablecoins because it \u201Cis the most secure and decentralized\u201D blockchain.\nBitcoin and stablecoins value as a store of value\nStark went on to discuss the merits of Bitcoin (BTC) and stablecoins as a store of value, especially in nations grappling with inflation issues and devaluing fiat currencies.\nAdvertisement\nJump in the Probably Serious Quiz and get 0% fees for USDt on TON and Toncoin exchanges on Changelly\nAd\nThe Lightning Labs CEO said stablecoin adoption has grown dramatically since the COVID-19 pandemic, with users largely being based in emerging markets.\n\u201CThe stickiest users have been those looking for a stable store of value. In some cases, they\u2019re using Bitcoin. In other cases, they\u2019re using stablecoins, and in some cases, it\u2019s a combination of both,\u201D Stark explained.\nRelated: What is the Bitcoin Lightning Network, and how does it work?\nThe two largest stablecoin players \u2014 Tether (USDT) and Circle\u2019s USD Coin (USDC) \u2014 hold more United States Treasury bonds combined than major nations like Germany and South Korea. Stark said this is an intriguing fact, given that end-users don\u2019t benefit from the interest of holding stablecoins.\nFor those in countries grappling with hyperinflation or precarious economic environments, the choice of holding a stablecoin is driven by the need for a store of value.\nLightning-powered stablecoins will be superior\nGiven the significant growth in value of the stablecoin market, Stark said there is a need for the infrastructure to enable the issuance of stablecoins and real-world assets on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\u201CThat\u2019s why we\u2019re building this protocol, this technology right now. We\u2019re not issuing assets, we\u2019re building the rails. Asset issuers will use our technology to issue real-world tokenized assets,\u201D Stark explained.\nRelated: Coinbase integrates Lightning Network for Bitcoin transactions\nThe CEO added that financial institutions could issue gold assets, stablecoins and other fiat-backed assets on Bitcoin and then transact over the Lightning Network.\nPerhaps most telling was the relative cost compared to other blockchains and conventional traditional finance systems, which Stark highlighted:\n\u201CIf you look at Visa where fees in the U.S. can be upward of 3%, or even 1%, the fees, transacting with stablecoins on Lightning can be dramatically lower, a cent or less than that.\u201D\nStark added that this could competitively enable people to transact globally at far lower rates than through traditional networks.\nMagazine: 68% of Runes are in the red \u2014 Are they really an upgrade for Bitcoin?\nExchange or buy BTC\nDisclaimer: The information contained on this widget is not intended as, and shall not be understood or construed as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

UCITS are often comprised of mutual, exchange-traded or money market funds. EU regulations govern these funds; however, non-EU investors can also gain exposure.\nUCITS stakeholders have until Aug. 7 to submit their comments. If approved, UCITS would become one of the largest mainstream funds with crypto exposure.\nAdvertisement\nTrade smart with Markets Pro instant alerts.

Thus, investors have to access them via exchange-traded notes.\nThe European Union is known for its strict crypto regulatory policy. It is one of the first regions to introduce a complete crypto regulatory framework in the form of its Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA).\nOne of the questions asked by the ESMA in the feedback is how adding specific cryptocurrencies to the framework would or wouldn\u2019t be affected by MiCA.\nMagazine: What do crypto market makers actually do?
